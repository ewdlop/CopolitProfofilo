# Proof Verification for nLab Coq Library

This document describes the proof verification system implemented for the nLab Coq library.

## Overview

The nLab Coq library contains formalized mathematical foundations including:
- **Foundations**: Logic, Sets, Relations
- **Category Theory**: Categories, Functors, Natural Transformations (in progress)
- **Type Theory**: Dependent Types, Inductive Types, Identity Types
- **Homotopy Type Theory**: Univalence Axiom, Higher Inductive Types, Homotopies
- **Topos Theory**: Elementary Toposes, Sheaves, Sites
- **Examples**: Finite Categories, Groups, Topology

## Proof Verification System

### Quick Start

To verify all proofs in the library:

```bash
# Using the make target (recommended)
make verify-proofs

# Or directly using the script
./verify_proofs.sh
```

### How It Works

The verification system:

1. **Reads the project configuration** from `_CoqProject` to determine which files to verify
2. **Compiles each Coq file** individually using `coqc` with proper library paths
3. **Reports verification status** for each file with colored output
4. **Generates a summary report** showing total files, successful verifications, and failures

### Current Status

As of the latest update, the verification system successfully verifies:

- âœ… **Foundations/Logic.v** - Basic logical foundations and definitions
- âœ… **Foundations/Sets.v** - Set theory fundamentals  
- âœ… **Foundations/Relations.v** - Relation theory
- âœ… **CategoryTheory/Categories.v** - Basic category definition and concepts
- âœ… **CategoryTheory/Functors.v** - Functor definitions and properties

### Files Currently Disabled

Some files are temporarily commented out in `_CoqProject` due to:
- Notation conflicts that need resolution
- Complex dependent type issues requiring additional axioms
- Dependencies on files that aren't yet building

These include:
- `CategoryTheory/NaturalTransformations.v` (notation conflicts)
- Higher-level category theory files
- Type theory modules
- Homotopy type theory modules

### Build Requirements

- **Coq 8.18.0** or compatible
- Standard Unix environment with `bash`
- `make` utility

### Verification Output

The script provides colored output:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green âœ“** - Proof verified successfully
- ðŸ”´ **Red âœ—** - Proof verification failed
- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** - Warning or error details

Example output:
```

```

### Integration with Development Workflow

The verification system integrates with the standard Coq development workflow:

1. **Before committing**: Run `make verify-proofs` to ensure all proofs are valid
2. **After changes**: Use verification to quickly check if modifications broke existing proofs
3. **CI/CD integration**: The script returns appropriate exit codes for automated testing

### Extending the Verification

To add new files to verification:

1. Add the `.v` file to the appropriate section in `_CoqProject`
2. Ensure the file compiles with `make`
3. Run `make verify-proofs` to verify the new file

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build failures**: First run `make clean && make` to ensure the library builds
2. **Missing dependencies**: Check that all `Require Import` statements reference available modules
3. **Coq version mismatch**: Ensure you're using a compatible Coq version

**Debug Mode:**
For detailed error information, check the individual error messages displayed when verification fails.

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the verification system:

- [ ] Parallel verification for faster processing
- [ ] Integration with proof timing analysis
- [ ] Automated fixing of common proof issues
- [ ] Web-based verification dashboard
- [ ] Proof coverage analysis

## Contributing

When contributing to the library:

1. Ensure your proofs pass verification before submitting
2. Add appropriate documentation for new theorems
3. Follow the existing code style and conventions
4. Test that verification still passes for the entire library

For more information about the mathematical content, see the individual `.v` files which contain detailed documentation of the formalized concepts.
