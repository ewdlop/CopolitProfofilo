  # Additive Group Laws
  rule additive_associativity under condition
    elements a, b, c in field
  consequence
    addition of (addition of a with b) with c equals
    addition of a with (addition of b with c)

  rule additive_identity under condition
    element a in field and zero in field
  consequence
    addition of a with zero equals a

  rule additive_inverse_law under condition
    element a in field with additive_inverse neg_a
  consequence
    addition of a with neg_a equals zero

  # Multiplicative Group Laws (excluding zero)
  rule multiplicative_associativity under condition
    elements a, b, c in field and
    a not_equal zero and b not_equal zero and c not_equal zero
  consequence
    multiplication of (multiplication of a with b) with c equals
    multiplication of a with (multiplication of b with c)

  rule multiplicative_identity under condition
    element a in field and one in field and a not_equal zero
  consequence
    multiplication of a with one equals a

  rule multiplicative_inverse_law under condition
    element a in field with multiplicative_inverse inv_a and
    a not_equal zero
  consequence
    multiplication of a with inv_a equals one

  # Distributive Law
  rule distributivity under condition
    elements a, b, c in field
  consequence
    multiplication of a with (addition of b with c) equals
    addition of (multiplication of a with b) with (multiplication of a with c)
