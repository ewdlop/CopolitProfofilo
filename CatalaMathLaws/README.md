# Mathematical Laws in Catala

This directory contains mathematical laws and principles expressed using the Catala domain-specific language syntax. While Catala is primarily designed for legal and regulatory formalization, we adapt its syntax to express fundamental mathematical laws that complement the Coq formalization in this repository.

## About Catala

Catala is a domain-specific language for deriving faithful-by-construction implementations from legislative texts. More information: https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala

## Mathematical Adaptation

We use Catala's structured rule syntax to express mathematical laws in a format that mirrors legal reasoning but applies to mathematical domains. This provides an alternative formal specification that complements the Coq proofs in this repository.
